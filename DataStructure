ArrayList, LinkedList: It stores all the values in INSERTED ORDER. And duplicate no's are not removed, it is stored.

1) D/W ArrayList vs LinkedList? (or) Which is more reliable?

Depending on the requirement, the usage many change.

In ArrayList, time taken is high for storing element.              In LinkedList, time taken is less for storing element.
In ArrayList, fetching a value is fast process.                     In LinkedList, fetching a value is slow process.


2) how to declare ArrayList and Linked List:
=========================================
List<Integer> a=new ArrayList<>();                                
****** ArrayList implements ClassList interface .


List<Integer> a=new LinkedList<>();  
********LinkedList Class implements List interface.

3) What is set inteface?
Works like List Interface, But it removes DUPLICATES and Keeps only UNIQUE VALUES.

Under set, 3 types:
********************
=>HashSet  =>the numbers which are listed in HashSet will be sorted RANDOM order, due to hashing concept.
=>LinkedHashSet  ==>behaves as like ArrayList(no's stored in INSERTED order), and Duplicates are removed.
=>TreeSet  => Always all no's are sorted in ASCENDING order form. 

how to declare Hashset:
=========================================
Set<Integer> a=new HashSet<>();                                
****** HashSet Class implements Set interface .

Set<Integer> a=new LinkedkedHashSet<>();    
****** LinkedHashSet Class implements Set interface .


Set<Integer> a=new TreeSet<>();          
****** TreeSet Class implements Set interface .

4)Map Interface:
================
HashMap Class implements Map Interface.
HashMap stores values in Key Value pair.<K,V>

for adding Key, Value in HashMap we go for "PUT" method.

Map<String,String> m=new HashMap<>();
m.put("vignesh","HCL");
m.put("eshwar","vishwam");
m.put("sakthi","zoho");

Here also, the same principle where dupicates are not allowed for Key values.
randomly the values are printed. 

Important methods used in MAP Class:
====================================
=>keySet()  -->used for taking only the KEY (We can get in only in Set).
=>values()  -->used for taking only the VALUE(We can get in only in Collections).
=>entrySet() -->used for taking both KEY, VALUE pair.(We can get in only in Set).


5) What is Iterator in Data structure?
 ====>An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet


6) How to convert list of numbers from ARRAYLIST to TREESET in Colection of JAVA?

i/p get as arguments from User. 

 List<Integer> numbers=new ArrayList<>();

      for(int i=0;i<args.length;i++){
          numbers.add(Integer.parseInt(args[i]));
      }

        System.out.println(numbers);

      Iterator<Integer> c=numbers.iterator();

      Set<Integer> s=new TreeSet<>();

      while(c.hasNext()){
          s.add(c.next());
      }

        System.out.println(s);
    }


7) D/W USER STORY and USE CASE??

USER STORY: A long description of functionality or feature which we required(from user perspective).

USER CASE: Short description of functionality or feature which we required(from user perspective).
